aplc-optimization: an apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph design survey toolkit
########################################################

.. warning::

   Pardon our dust, this space is under construction.

``aplc-optimization`` is a Python software toolkit for exploring apodized pupil lyot coronagraph (APLC)
solutions for segmented telescope pupils. Its object-orientated approach simplifies
the interface for sampling large parameter spaces, and enables flexibility for implementing various mask architectures
and symmetry cases. The core module, example notebooks, and documentation are privately hosted at
github.com/spacetelescope/aplc-optimization.

- The ``aplc-optimization`` *package was created in support of the Segmented Coronagraph Design and Analysis (SCDA) study,
funded by NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP). The goal of this study is to develop viable coronagraph
instrument concepts for a LUVOIR-type mission. The apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph (APLC) is one of several
coronagraph design families that the SCDA study is assessing.
