aplc-optimization: an apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph design survey toolkit
########################################################

``aplc-optimization`` is a Python software toolkit for exploring apodized pupil lyot coronagraph (APLC)
solutions for abitrary telescope apertures. It's object-orientated approach simplifies
the interface for sampling large parameter spaces, and enables flexibility for implementing various mask architectures
and symmetry cases.

The `aplc-optimization` toolkit was developed by the `Segmented Coronagraph Design & Analysis (SCDA) research team <https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/research-topics-and-programs/russell-b-makidon-optics-laboratory/meet-the-team>`_ at the Space Telescope Science Institute
(STScI) with the support of the `NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP) <https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exep/technology/SCDA/>`_ and is privately hosted at `github.com/spacetelescope/aplc-optimization <github.com/spacetelescope/aplc-optimization>`_.

The goal of this study is to develop viable coronagraph instrument concepts for a LUVOIR-type mission. The apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph (APLC) is one of several coronagraph design families that the SCDA study is assessing.
