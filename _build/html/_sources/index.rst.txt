aplc-optimization: an apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph design survey toolkit
########################################################

.. warning::

   Pardon our dust, this space is under construction.

``aplc-optimization`` is a Python software toolkit for exploring apodized pupil lyot coronagraph (APLC)
solutions for segmented telescope pupils. It's object-orientated approach simplifies
the interface for sampling large parameter spaces, and enables flexibility for implementing various mask architectures
and symmetry cases. The toolkit is privately hosted at github.com/spacetelescope/aplc-optimization.

- The ``aplc-optimization`` *package was created in support of the Segmented Coronagraph Design and Analysis (SCDA) study, funded by NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP). The goal of this study is to develop viable coronagraph instrument concepts for a LUVOIR-type mission. The apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph (APLC) is one of several coronagraph design families that the SCDA study is assessing.
