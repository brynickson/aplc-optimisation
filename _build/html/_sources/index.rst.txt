.. warning::

   Pardon our dust, this space is under construction.

``aplc-optimization`` is an object-orientated software toolkit
to automate the exploration of APLC design parameter combinations for segmented and obscured telescope apertures.
The toolkit is privately hosted at https://github.com/spacetelescope/aplc-optimization.

**Contributors:** ``aplc-optimization`` has been developed by Emeil Por, Katherine St Laurent, Remi Soummer, Bryony Nickson and Kelsey Glazer.

*The* ``aplc-optimization`` *package was created in support of the Segmented Coronagraph Design and Analysis (SCDA) study,
funded by NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP). The goal of this study is to develop viable coronagraph
instrument concepts for a LUVOIR-type mission. The apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph (APLC) is one of several
coronagraph design families that the SCDA study is assessing.*
