*The* ``aplc-optimization`` *package was created in support of the Segmented Coronagraph Design and Analysis (SCDA) study,
funded by NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP). The goal of this study is to develop viable coronagraph
instrument concepts for a LUVOIR-type mission. The apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph (APLC) is one of several
coronagraph design families that the SCDA study is assessing.*
